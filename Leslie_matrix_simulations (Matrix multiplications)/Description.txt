This is the first assignment I did as part of Julian Mak's Data Analysis in Ocean Science course. I felt the need to upload my work here to showcase everything I learned under MakÂ´s brilliant teaching.
This first assignment had to do with simulating populations in a habitat using a Leslie matrix. THis works by splitting the a single (or multiple species) into different age classes, and on each instance, the individuals
in a given age class have a 'chance' of advancing to the next age class, a chance of dying, and a chance of producing offspring. In a sense, a Leslie matrix gives the population at time = t+1 using the population
at time = t. I executed the model using a population of asian elephants, and with sauropod dinosaurs using a crafted Leslie matrix. Said models were visualized with animations in matplotlib and plotly, crafting population
pyramids at any given time. The results were good but there were some space for improvement, like changing initial conditions or adding stochastic variation for example.
