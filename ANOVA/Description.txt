I coded the ANOVA test almost from scratch, as I used only numpy for the algorithm, only employing scipy to obtain F fisher values. The ANOVA algorithm mentioned was coded mostly with
for loops and nested for loops, providing an excellent sample of how to translate math and statistical algorithms to computer programming. 
This program was adapted from a python script I made for an statistics class.I coded this project on my own (it wasnÂ´t course work, I did it by myself!), so it is specially important
for me, as it was my return to actually learning python programming and computer logic.
