Here is the showcase of the third assignment I did on professor Julien Mak´s class. It had to do with temperature internal ocean waves. Data was in .tab files, and an adequate function was defined to read this unusual format.
Afterwards, trends were obtained, lag correlation coefficients were mapped out, and Fourier analysis was performed. Insights were that the combination of el niño phenomena and climate change were causing temperature swings
that caused the environment to be inhospitable to coral reefs, increasing the frequency of coral bleaching events.
