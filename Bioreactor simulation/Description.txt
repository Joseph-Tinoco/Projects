Created a simulation to model batch bioreactors using differential equations. To simplify inputs, an excel file is provided to enter time to simulate, initial biomass, 
initial substrate, initial product, miu-max, Ks monod value, Kd cell death rate, gamma product denaturation rate, X/S yield and P/X yield. These values can be in hours, but 
values in minutes can be used for further accuracy. 
Moreover, I also made a continuos bioreactor version where dilution rate and substrate in feed are also required, allowing the modeling of this kind of operation mode.
Using these factors, the program graphs the differential equations to model biomass,substrate and product concentratios, providing useful insights for bioprocess development.
